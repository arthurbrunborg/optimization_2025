# Lab Sessions – Guidelines and Schedule

## General Guidelines

- All exercises are provided in **pairs of Jupyter notebooks**:  
  - The **questions notebook** contains the problem statement and skeleton code.  
    → Your task is to complete the missing code.  
  - The **solutions notebook** contains the fully worked-out answers.  

- If you get blocked, **consult the solutions**.  
  - If you are new to Python, you will likely need to do this regularly at first.  
  - This is perfectly normal and a good way to learn.  

- You may also consult **online resources** and **AI agents**.  
  - Use them carefully: the goal is to understand your work.  
  - Solving the exercises without comprehension is not useful.  

- Below you will find a **suggested organization of topics** throughout the semester.  
  - This is **indicative** only.  
  - In the first weeks, you may not have time to complete all the suggested material.  
  - This is fine — you can return to it later.
