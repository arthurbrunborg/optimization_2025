# Introduction to Optimization — Exercises

This directory contains the first set of labs for the course.  
The overall **objective** is to learn how to create an optimization model for a simple problem and solve it using an existing solver.  

For each lab, two files are provided:  
- `*_questions.ipynb`: the notebook with exercises to be completed.  
- `*_responses.ipynb`: the notebook with solutions.

## Contents

### Basic Modeling and Solving
- **`lab01_coola_questions.ipynb`** / **`lab01_coola_responses.ipynb`**  
  First exercise: build and solve a very simple optimization model.  

- **`lab02_projectile_questions.ipynb`** / **`lab02_projectile_responses.ipynb`**  
  Optimization model for a projectile problem.  

- **`lab03_projectile_2_questions.ipynb`** / **`lab03_projectile_2_responses.ipynb`**  
  Extension of the projectile problem: solving with constraints and solver interaction.  

### Theory and Model Transformation
- **`lab04_kkt_questions.ipynb`** / **`lab04_kkt_responses.ipynb`**  
  Exercise on the **Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions**.  

- **`lab05_standard_form_questions.ipynb`** / **`lab05_standard_form_responses.ipynb`**  
  How to transform a linear optimization model into **standard form**.  

### Existence of Solutions
- **`lab06_existence_questions.ipynb`** / **`lab06_existence_responses.ipynb`**  
  Exercise (no coding): analyze whether an optimization problem has a solution.

## How to Work With These Notebooks

1. Open the `*_questions.ipynb` notebooks in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.  
2. Try to solve the exercises on your own.  
3. If you are blocked or want to check your work, open the corresponding `*_responses.ipynb`.  
4. Make sure to compare your solution with the responses — often there are multiple valid approaches.
