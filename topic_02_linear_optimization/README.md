# Linear Optimization â€” Labs

This directory contains exercises and solutions related to the fundamentals of **linear optimization**.  
Each lab is split into two notebooks:  
- `*_questions.ipynb`: notebook with exercises to solve.  
- `*_responses.ipynb`: notebook with solutions.

## How to Use

1. Open the `*_questions.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.  
2. Work through the exercises.  
3. Check your work using the corresponding `*_responses.ipynb`.

These labs progressively introduce key building blocks of the simplex method and linear optimization theory, from feasibility and directions to reduced costs and redundancy.
