# Simplex and Linear Optimization Exercises

This directory contains a series of Jupyter notebooks introducing different methods for solving linear optimization problems. Each lab comes in two versions:
- `*_questions.ipynb`: exercises for you to solve
- `*_responses.ipynb`: solutions and explanations

## Contents

- **lab01_enumeration**  
  - *questions*: Solve an optimization problem using **vertex enumeration**.  
  - *responses*: Worked-out solution.  

- **lab02_graphical**  
  - *questions*: Solve an optimization problem using the **graphical method**.  
  - *responses*: Worked-out solution.  

- **lab03_simplex**  
  - *questions*: Implement the **simplex algorithm** to find the optimal solution.  
  - *responses*: Implementation and solution.  

- **lab04_tableau**  
  - *questions*: Extract information from a **simplex tableau**.  
  - *responses*: Example solutions.  

- **lab05_pivoting**  
  - *questions*: Implement the **pivoting step** of the simplex tableau.  
  - *responses*: Implementation and solution.  

- **lab06_simplex_tableau**  
  - *questions*: Implement the **simplex tableau algorithm** to find the optimal solution.  
  - *responses*: Implementation and solution.  

- **lab07_phase_one**  
  - *questions*: Solve three optimization problems using the **phase one simplex algorithm**.  
  - *responses*: Worked-out solutions.  

- **lab08_multiple_choice**  
  - *questions*: A set of **conceptual multiple-choice exercises** (no Python coding required).  
  - *responses*: Correct answers with explanations.

## Suggested Workflow
1. Start with the **questions notebook** of each lab.  
2. Try to solve the problems step by step.  
3. If you get stuck, check the corresponding **responses notebook** for hints or full solutions.  
4. Use earlier labs (enumeration and graphical methods) to build intuition before tackling the simplex algorithm.  

This progression will help you move from basic intuition to implementing the full simplex algorithm and related techniques.
