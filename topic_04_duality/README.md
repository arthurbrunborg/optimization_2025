# Duality Exercises

This directory contains a set of notebooks dedicated to practicing concepts of **duality in optimization**.  
Some exercises are purely analytical (no Python coding), while others guide you to apply theoretical tools like **complementarity slackness**.

## Contents

- **lab01_feasibility_questions.ipynb**  
  Exercise on feasibility in the context of duality. No Python coding required.  
- **lab01_feasibility_responses.ipynb**  
  Detailed solutions for the feasibility exercise.

- **lab02_dual_problem_questions.ipynb**  
  Exercise on formulating and analyzing the dual problem. No Python coding required.  
- **lab02_dual_problem_responses.ipynb**  
  Step-by-step solutions for the dual problem exercise.

- **lab03_complementarity_slackness_questions.ipynb**  
  Exercise focused on using the complementarity slackness conditions to solve the dual problem.  
- **lab03_complementarity_slackness_responses.ipynb**  
  Complete worked-out solution to the complementarity slackness exercise.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Start with the **questions** notebooks and work through the problems on your own.  
2. Use the corresponding **responses** notebooks to check your reasoning and verify your answers.  
3. Pay particular attention to the logic of complementarity slackness in **lab03**, as it provides a systematic way to connect primal and dual solutions.  
4. Try to explain your steps in words â€” this will help you internalize the duality principles beyond just calculations.
