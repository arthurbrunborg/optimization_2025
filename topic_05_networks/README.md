# Network Optimization Exercises

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks designed to introduce and practice key concepts in **network optimization**.  
The exercises make use of the Python package [`networkx`](https://networkx.org/) for modeling and analyzing graphs.

## Contents

- **lab01_network_representation_questions.ipynb**  
  Use the `networkx` package to explore different ways of representing networks and to investigate their properties.  
- **lab01_network_representation_responses.ipynb**  
  Complete solutions and explanations for the network representation exercises.

- **lab02_flows_divergences_questions.ipynb**  
  Exercises focusing on flows and divergences in networks, including the balance of incoming and outgoing flows at nodes.  
- **lab02_flows_divergences_responses.ipynb**  
  Worked-out solutions for the flows and divergences exercises.

- **lab03_trees_questions.ipynb**  
  Exercises on trees and their structural properties.  
- **lab03_trees_responses.ipynb**  
  Full solutions for the tree-related exercises.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Start with the **questions** notebooks and try to solve the problems on your own.  
2. Use the **responses** notebooks to check your reasoning, fill gaps, or verify your solutions.  
3. Make sure to run the Python code and explore `networkx` methods interactively â€” experimenting with the library will help you build intuition about networks.  
4. If you are new to `networkx`, you may want to skim its [documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/) for quick reference.

These exercises provide a foundation for understanding how networks can be modeled and analyzed computationally, which is a key step before studying more advanced optimization problems on networks.
