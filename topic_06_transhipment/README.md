  Complete solutions for the total unimodularity exercise.

- **lab02_shortest_path_questions.ipynb**  
  Calculate a **shortest path** by formulating it as a transhipment problem.  
- **lab02_shortest_path_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the shortest path exercise.

- **lab03_standard_form_questions.ipynb**  
  Transform a transhipment problem into a **network-compatible standard form**.

- **lab04_optimality_conditions_questions.ipynb**  
  Investigate the **dual properties** of the transhipment problem.  
- **lab04_optimality_conditions_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the optimality conditions exercise.

- **lab05_maximum_flow_questions.ipynb**  
  Model and solve a **maximum flow** problem using the transhipment formulation.  
- **lab05_maximum_flow_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the maximum flow exercise.

- **lab06_transportation_questions.ipynb**  
  Model and solve a **transportation problem** using the transhipment formulation.  
- **lab06_transportation_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the transportation exercise.

- **lab07_train_tickets_questions.ipynb**  
  Model and solve an **assignment problem** (train ticket allocation) using the transhipment formulation.  
- **lab07_train_tickets_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the train tickets assignment exercise.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Begin with the **questions** notebooks to attempt the exercises independently.  
2. Use the **responses** notebooks to compare, verify, and learn from the provided solutions.  
3. Pay attention to how different optimization problems (shortest path, maximum flow, transportation, assignment) can all be formulated within the **transhipment framework**.  
4. Experiment with variations of the problems to deepen your understanding.
