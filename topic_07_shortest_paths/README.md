# Shortest Path and PERT Exercises

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks on **shortest path algorithms** and the **Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)**.  
Each exercise has a corresponding *questions* notebook for practice and a *responses* notebook with complete solutions.

## Contents

- **lab01_generic_algorithm_questions.ipynb**  
  Implement and apply the **generic shortest path algorithm** to identify the shortest paths from a given node to all other nodes.  
- **lab01_generic_algorithm_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the generic shortest path algorithm exercise.

- **lab02_bellman_questions.ipynb**  
  Construct **Bellman subnetworks** from the optimal labels of the shortest path algorithm.  
- **lab02_bellman_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the Bellman subnetworks exercise.

- **lab03_dikstra_algorithm_questions.ipynb**  
  Implement and apply **Dijkstra's algorithm** to identify the shortest paths from a given node to all other nodes.  
- **lab03_dikstra_algorithm_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the Dijkstra algorithm exercise.

- **lab04_pert_questions.ipynb**  
  Model and solve a **Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)** problem.  
- **lab04_pert_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the PERT exercise.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Start with the *questions* notebooks and try to solve the exercises on your own.  
2. Once you are confident or if you are stuck, check the corresponding *responses* notebooks.  
3. Pay attention to the differences between the algorithms (generic, Bellman, Dijkstra) and their use cases.  
4. Explore how PERT builds on shortest path techniques to analyze project timelines.

These exercises will help you understand the foundations of **graph algorithms** for shortest paths and their applications in project management through **PERT analysis**.
