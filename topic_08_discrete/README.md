# Discrete Optimization Exercises

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks dedicated to **discrete optimization**.  
Some exercises focus on modeling decision problems, while others involve implementing algorithms or exploring relaxation techniques.  
Each exercise comes in two parts: a *questions* notebook for practice and a *responses* notebook with solutions.  

## Contents

- **lab01_branch_and_bound_questions.ipynb**  
  Implement the **branch and bound algorithm** to solve mixed-integer linear optimization problems.  
- **lab01_branch_and_bound_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the branch and bound exercise.  

- **lab02_modeling_questions.ipynb**  
  Model a decision problem as a **discrete optimization problem**.  
  *This exercise does not require coding in Python.*  
- **lab02_modeling_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the modeling exercise.  

- **lab03_set_covering_questions.ipynb**  
  Formulate a **set covering problem** as a discrete optimization model.  
  *This exercise does not require coding in Python.*  
- **lab03_set_covering_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the set covering exercise.  

- **lab04_tsp_questions.ipynb**  
  Model a **traveling salesman problem (TSP)** as a discrete optimization problem.  
  *This exercise does not require coding in Python.*  
- **lab04_tsp_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the TSP exercise.  

- **lab05_relaxation_questions.ipynb**  
  Investigate the use of **relaxation techniques** in solving discrete optimization problems.  
- **lab05_relaxation_responses.ipynb**  
  Solutions for the relaxation exercise.  

## Suggested Workflow

1. Start with the *questions* notebooks and try to model or solve the problems on your own.  
2. Use the *responses* notebooks to check your reasoning and verify your solutions.  
3. Pay special attention to the difference between **modeling exercises** (no coding required) and **algorithmic exercises** (branch and bound, relaxation).  
4. Reflect on how discrete optimization problems are formulated and solved, and how relaxation can simplify or approximate them.
