# Nonlinear Optimization Exercises

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks focusing on **nonlinear optimization methods**.  
The exercises cover Wolfe conditions, Newton’s method, preconditioning, line search techniques, and conceptual multiple-choice questions.  
Each exercise comes in two versions: a *questions* notebook for practice and a *responses* notebook with solutions.

## Suggested Workflow

1. Start with the **Wolfe condition exercises** (lab01–lab02) to understand line search requirements.  
2. Move on to **Newton’s local method** (lab03) to study the idea of quadratic approximation.  
3. Explore **preconditioning** (lab04) to see how it affects convergence.  
4. Investigate the **validity of Wolfe conditions** (lab05).  
5. Practice the **inexact line search method** (lab06).  
6. Test your understanding with the **multiple-choice questions** (lab07).
